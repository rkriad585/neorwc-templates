## Required Files

### 1. docs/tutorial/intro.md
- Explain what the project is and why it is useful
- Include a simple illustrative example
- Start with a large H1 header
- End with a "Next Step" link to `get_started.md`

### 2. docs/tutorial/get_started.md
- Show the simplest possible setup or installation
- Include minimal working code or commands
- Start with a large H1 header
- End with a "Next Step" link to `syntax.md`

### 3. docs/tutorial/syntax.md
