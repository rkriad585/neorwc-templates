# Plan: Usage Cookbook & Snippets

## Objective
Generate a practical collection of copy-pasteable code snippets demonstrating how to use the project in real scenarios, from basic usage to advanced configurations and framework integrations.

---

## Required Files

### 1. docs/examples/basic_usage.md
- "Hello World" example demonstrating core functionality
- Minimal working code block
- Include expected output for verification

### 2. docs/examples/advanced_configuration.md
- Show usage with custom options, flags, or parameters detected in the code
- Include short examples modifying behavior
- Explain impact of configuration changes

### 3. docs/examples/integration.md
- Demonstrate integration with popular frameworks (React, Express, Django, etc.)
- Include realistic scenarios (e.g., connecting to a database, processing a CSV, calling APIs)
- Provide working code snippets ready to copy and execute

---

## Documentation Standards
- Focus on actionable, copy-pasteable code blocks
- Base examples strictly on real code and detected usage patterns
- Keep language concise and beginner-friendly
- Include expected output or verification steps where possible

---

## Analysis Method
1. Scan `tests/`, `examples/`, or demo scripts for valid usage patterns
2. Extract key functionality and configuration options
3. Create practical examples demonstrating core, advanced, and integration usage
4. Organize snippets into logical sections for easy reference
