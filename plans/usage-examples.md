# Plan: Usage Cookbook & Snippets

**Goal:** Create a collection of copy-pasteable code snippets for users.

**Required Files:**
1.  **`docs/examples/basic_usage.md`**:
    - The "Hello World" example.
2.  **`docs/examples/advanced_configuration.md`**:
    - How to use custom options/flags found in the code.
3.  **`docs/examples/integration.md`**:
    - How to combine this project with common frameworks (React, Express, Django, etc).

**Instructions:**
- Look at `tests/` or `examples/` folders in the source code to infer valid usage patterns.
- Create realistic scenarios (e.g., "Connecting to a Database", "Processing a CSV").
